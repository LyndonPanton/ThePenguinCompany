			<p id="introduction-text">Penguins are a group of flightless bird which most of its species reside in the Southern Hemisphere. Features they have include black and white plumage which they use as camouflage, flippers greatly resembling the wings from which they evolved from and their streamlined body which the birds use to swim with great expertise to hunt for their prey. As an bird which spends around 50% of its lifetime in the sea, a penguins primary diet consists of small shrimp, fish, crustaceans, and squid. Numbers vary depending on the authority followed but there are usually consider to be from 17 to 20 species of penguin.</p>

				<p class="species-details">This is the tallest and heaviest of all extant penguins and can reach height of 122cm and weight of 45kg. The can dive for up to 18 minutes and adaptions used to help with this are their haemoglobin structure to all them to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma and the ability to shut down non-essential organ functions. They have the second lowest conservation status, <em>Near Threatened</em>, have an average lifespan of 20 years and are endemic to Antartica.</p>
