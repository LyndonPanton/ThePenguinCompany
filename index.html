			<p>Penguins are a group of flightless bird which most of its species reside in the Southern Hemisphere. Features they have include black and white plumage which they use as camouflage, flippers greatly resembling the wings from which they evolved from and their streamlined body which the birds use to swim with great expertise to hunt for their prey. As an bird which spends around 50% of its lifetime in the sea, a penguins primary diet consists of small shrimp, fish, crustaceans, and squid. Numbers vary depending on the authority followed but there are usually consider to be from 17 to 20 species of penguin.</p>

			<h2>Notable Species</h2>

			<div>
				<h3>Emperor Penguin</h3>
				<p title="Without wings diver" lang="la"><em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em></p>
				<p>This is the tallest and heaviest of all extant penguins and can reach height of 122cm and weight of 45kg. The can dive for up to 18 minutes and adaptions used to help with this are their haemoglobin structure to all them to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma and the ability to shut down non-essential organ functions. They have the second lowest conservation status, <em>Near Threatened</em>, have an average lifespan of 20 years and are endemic to Antartica.</p>

					<h4>Fun Facts</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>They are an extremely social animal and hunt, breed and travel in colonies</li>
						<li>After a female lays an egg and returns to the sea to feed, the male will look after the egg for two months and eat nothing during this period</li>
						<li>Some can live up to 50 years</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Galapogas</h3>
				<p title="???" lang="la"><em>Spheniscus mendiculus</em></p>
				<p>This is the second smallest species of penguin and are the only one to be found north of the equator (the Galapagos islands). They are confined to the archipelago spending their time foraging during the day and return to the surface during the night. They have a conservation status of <em>endangered</em> and are one of the few penguins which are known to mate for life and the juvenile plumage they gain around 30 days after they are born are used mainly to protect them from the sun rather than keep them warm.</p>

				<div>
					<h4>Fun Facts</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>They are currently the most endangered species of penguins</li>
						<li>They use thermoregulation habitats to keep their bodies cool while on land</li>
						<li>Because of their small size they may fall prey to animals such as crabs, rats and owls</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Rockhopper</h3>
				<p title="???" lang="la"><em>Eudyptes chrysocome</em></p>
				<p>This penguin is widely disputed among experts as to whether it is actually a species or classification. It was three variations (Southern, Eastern, Northern) which some consider to be three different species while other think they are all the same species. They are amoung the smaller species of penguin ranging from about 7.6 centimetres to 56 centimetres , the sexes cannot be distinguished by appearance and is done via DNA. Notable features the species do have are their red eyes, pink feet and spiky yellow feathers on their head. They have a conservation status of vunerable.</p>

				<div>
					<h4>Fun Facts</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>They can be at sea for several days while hunting</li>
						<li>They make their nests and burrows in tall grass called tussocks</li>
						<li>As they live in rocky environment they do not slide like most penguins and so they hop instead, hence their name</li>
					</ul>
