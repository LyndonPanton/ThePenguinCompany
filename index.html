			<p>Penguins are a group of flightless bird which most of its species reside in the Southern Hemisphere. Features they have include black and white plumage which they use as camouflage, flippers greatly resembling the wings from which they evolved from and their streamlined body which the birds use to swim with great expertise to hunt for their prey. As an bird which spends around 50% of its lifetime in the sea, a penguins primary diet consists of small shrimp, fish, crustaceans, and squid. Numbers vary depending on the authority followed but there are usually consider to be from 17 to 20 species of penguin.</p>
